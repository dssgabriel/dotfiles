* What are dotfiles?
In the Unix world, programs are configured either via shell arguments or plain-text files, often starting with a period (a dot), hence their name. You may notice that many of the dotfiles contain ~rc~ at the end of their name (~.bashrc~, ~.vimrc~, etc...). Those are "runcom" files that contain an application's startup instructions. These dotfiles are used to customize and/or personalize your programs to make your system truly unique.

# The goal of my setup was to create a minimal, distraction-free, work environment using the least amount of hardware resources (less than 300MB of memory usage at idle). [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/themeing/dictionary#wiki_rice][Ricing]] and other visual improvements were a secondary goal. The color scheme is meant to be easy on the eyes, with a low contrast between colors (unlike Gruvbox, which my theme, [[https://gitlab.com/snakedye/chocolate][Chocolate]], is based on). It also avoids blueish colors which cause strain and fatigue.

This repository stores the current configuration of my system so that I can quickly access it when doing an install on a new machine or VM. Of course, you are free to use all or parts of this repository for your own config!
